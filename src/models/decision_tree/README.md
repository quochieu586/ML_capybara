## 1. Overview of Decision Tree Algorithm

### **What is Decision Tree?**
A **Decision Tree** is a supervised learning algorithm that splits data recursively based on feature conditions to make predictions.

### **How It Works:**
1. The algorithm selects the best feature to split data using **Entropy (Information Gain)**.
2. It recursively divides data until a stopping condition is met.
3. The final tree is used to classify new inputs.

## 2. Key Features

### **Feature Selection**
- Uses **Entropy and Information Gain** to determine the best splitting feature.

### **Tree Growth**
- Recursively divides data until reaching a stopping condition (e.g., max depth, minimum samples per leaf).

### **Decision Making**
- Once trained, the tree classifies new data by traversing from the root node to a leaf node.

## 3. Model Architecture

### **Input Layer:**
- Features extracted from the dataset.

### **Decision Nodes:**
- Internal nodes where feature-based splits occur.

### **Leaf Nodes:**
- Final classification output (predicted class label).

## 4. Hyperparameter Tuning

### **Optimized Parameters:**
- **Max Depth:** Controls tree complexity to prevent overfitting.
- **Min Samples per Leaf:** Ensures a minimum number of samples per terminal node.
- **Criterion:** Determines the metric for selecting splits (e.g., Gini or Entropy).

## 6. Model Strengths

### **Interpretability:**
- Decision Trees are easy to understand and visualize.

### **Handling of Different Data Types:**
- Works with both numerical and categorical data.

### **Minimal Data Preprocessing:**
- Does not require feature scaling or normalization.

## 7. Model Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement

### **Overfitting:**
- Trees can become too complex and memorize training data.
- **Solution:** Use pruning techniques or set depth constraints.

### **Class Imbalance:**
- Model performance may degrade if one class dominates.
- **Solution:** Apply class weighting or resampling techniques.

### **Limited Generalization:**
- Decision Trees may not perform well on unseen data.
- **Solution:** Use ensemble methods like **Random Forest** or **Gradient Boosting**.

## 8. Conclusion
The **Decision Tree model** provides a **simple yet powerful** approach for classification. While it achieves **60% accuracy**, improvements can be made through **hyperparameter tuning, handling class imbalance, and exploring ensemble methods** for better generalization.
